# In the first day of learning, I tried to learn pandas. Pandas mean Panel Data and Python
# Data Analysis. Pandas mainly workks as a data filtering concepts where it can remove unnecessary null data or unnecessary data
# which can help the dataset to be modified or to be cleared. I made to learn reading csv files, data analyze segments like 
# finding min max, average or even correlation in between datasets etc.
